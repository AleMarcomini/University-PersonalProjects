    "We will be working with a dataset of NBA basketball players data (you can get from https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/nba-player-of-the-week the full dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data is a subset of the Kaggle dataset containing the players that have the role of Center and of Point Guard. For each player the dataset contains 3 features, the height, the weight and the age.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia (if you are not a basketball fan!!):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Center (C), also known as the five, or the big man, is one of the five positions in a regular basketball game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the NBA, the center is usually 6' 10\" (2.08 m) or taller and usually weighs 240 lbs (109 kg) or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Point Guards (PG, a.k.a. as \"play maker\") are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 3\" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2\" (1.88 m). Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling. \n",
    "\n",

    "The two selected features are the weight and the height of the players, since those are the most characterizing ones for the roles (the age does not really change anything). However, the error rate on the (reduced) test set after the regression run on the reduced training set is identical to the three-features case. In first, this result surprised me: since the age of the players is clearly uncorrelated (from a statistical point of view we may assume it is randomly assigned), i thought it contributes to a misclassification on data points. However, it is true that since this feature is not statistically relevant, the actual classification of the roles in the case of three features considered is dominated by the weight and height. So it seems fair that considering just w and h the result should not change."

It can be possible that just a subset of those is actually in linear dependence with the labels. The error on the three sets belongs to the same order of magnitude, even though in absolute value the one of the training set is bigger than the test one. Anyway, since the validation data are not actually used for hyperparameters estimation, their funcion is similar to the test data and the average error between those two set is slighlty higher than the training set, as expected (i.e, the absolute value of the error "

# University Personal Projects
Hello world! üòÉ 

This repo aims to be a coding **portfolio** in which I am presenting and making available all the works I did during my Master degree in Physis of Data at University of Padova, between 2020 and 2022. You can find several folders, related to assignments and/or final projects on various topics. Feel free to **be curious** and get inspired by these works! ü§ì

I tried my best in order to present everything in a proper way: in most of cases, you will find code in form of Jupyter Notebooks (which I am sure you know a lot about); if additional information is required, you will likely find it in PDFs or in the READMEs. In any case, feel free to **contact me**, also to give me a feedback about how to improve my works (I am always open to learning and establishing collaborations). You are free to use some pieces of code from this repo, as well as trying to reproduce results: I choose a CC0 licence for this. However, let me confess you that I could not learn so much about software without trying on my own or with colleagues to solve the thousands (not joking üòÖ) of bugs I encountered: I firmly suggest you to create your own **solutions**, also for personal satisfaction.

Below you find a summary of folders content. Have a nice stay and enjoy! üòÑ 

## Laboratory of Computational Phyiscs - mod A üíª
In this course I discovered all the major tricks of **Python**, learning how to use libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit learn and numba. You will find several **assignments and code exempla** that I tried to design in an elegant way. 

## Laboratory of Computational Physics - mod B üîã
As a natural sequel of the mod A, this course aimed to teach **machine learning methods for physics analysis**, from gradient descent techniques to clustering and RBMs. You will find a set of commented exercises and a **final project on the simulation of a quantum many-body wavefunction via neural networks**, to investigate the ground state of the Trasverse Field Ising model.

## Quantum Information and Computing üë®‚Äçüíª
In this course I learned how to properly design and use code for **numerical simulations** in the theoretical physics framework. I used Fortran to dig into problems such as solving Schr√∂dinger's equations and simulate **many-body quantum systems** via Renormalization Group techniques and **Tensor Networks**.
In my final project I applied the latter technology to the problem of **discriminating true (quantum) random and pseudo random numbers**. *The code I used is under NDA, but I provide the presentation and **poster** I promoted at the 2022 European Spring School in Quantum Science and Technology in Strasbourg.*

## Machine Learning ü§ñ
In this course I learned the bases of machine learning and got trained in using both **supervised and unsupervised learning techniques**. I collected here all my **assignments**, where I investigated different case-studies and practical examples.

## Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis üìà
Here I report my work on statistical analysis in different frameworks (either physics-related or not) exploiting the programming language **R**. You can find a large amount of exercises dealing with several techniques, among all **simulations, data sampling and Bayesian inference**. It is worth mentioning two particolarly interesting projects:
* A **game** I invented to understand Bayesian Inference (tutorial and gameplay [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alessandro-marcomini_bayesian-inference-game-activity-6798181020328951808-DHBu))
* A **final project on Bayesian Network** detection, with some technical methods, that we also **added to the open-source library Bnstruct** (which I provide in here with our updates).

## Quantum Communication and Cryptography üîê
Here I report my work for labs where I investigated **Quantum Random Number Generators** (QRNGs) and **Quantum Key Distribution** (QKD) both from an experimental (photon-based) and theoretical point of view. For the former problem (Lab1) I compare different methods that provide **theoretical bounds on the amount of secret true random bits** to be extracted in the setup. For the latter (Lab3) I estimate the **Secret Key Rate** in presence of leakages, defining post-processing techniques. In Lab2 I provide additional material on Low-Density Parity-Check codes. 
I also upload here the **full lecture notes of the course** that I took in collaboration with some friends, revisited by the Professors. 

## Game Theory üé≤ + üèéÔ∏è
For the final project of this course I developed a **Formula 1 simulator** that predicts the outcome of a Grand Prix assuming all drivers are **rational decision-makers** in a **dynamic game-theoretical framework**. The program is fully customizable and relies on real-world data, including features such as pit-stops, tyre aging, safety car, human mistakes, etc. 
I also provide the **draft paper** me and my colleagues wrote on the basis of our results.

## Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets - part I ‚öôÔ∏è
In this course I learned fundamentals of hardware, with particular focus on the state of the art. I got taught how to use **VHD Language** to instruct Field Programmable Gate Arrays (**FPGAs**). 
In the **final project**, I wrote the code to implement a **FIR filter on an actual FPGA board**, with proper benchmarking and test.

## Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets - part II üíæ
Suppose you are registering a large (I mean, VERY LARGE) amount of data per second: how can you store them in a pratical, efficient way minimizing failures and allowing for reconstruction? Here I learned a lot about data storage and recollection. 
In the **final assignment**, I investigated some case-sudy scenarios of **parity protocols and blockchain** development.

## Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets - part III üï∏Ô∏è
In this course I learned the functioning of **distributed calculus** and how to exploit **Dask** and **Spark** to allow for a network-based execution of demanding computations. 
In the **final project** we performend in such a way an analysis of **CERN data** to reconstruct muons trajectories, aiming to optimize the code for parallel execution. 

## Computer Vision and Cognitive Services üñºÔ∏è
Here I post my work in the framework of **image recognition, feature extraction and classification** with several different techniques of computer vision. In my **final project**, I investigated multiple machine learning methods and vision tools to perform **vehicle detection and classification** on a video recorded by highway surveillance cameras, defining accurate metrics and discussing results. 

## Network Science üß†
I propose here the final report of an investigation of the **Redflags and Cancel Culture on Twitter** in late 2021. The whole work is the summary of the effort of a team of eigth people and two months of work. This experience taught me how to deal with **social media** and use them as **information source**, scrape and organize data, analyse them in a convenient way to extrapolate features and results of interest.

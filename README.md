# University Personal Projects
Hello world! 😃 

This repo aims to be a coding **portfolio** in which I am presenting and making available all the works I did during my Master degree in Physis of Data at University of Padova, between 2020 and 2022. You can find several folders, related to assignments and/or final projects on various topics. Feel free to **be curious** and get inspired by these works! 🤓

I tried my best in order to present everything in a proper way: in most of cases, you will find code in form of Jupyter Notebooks (which I am sure you know a lot about); if additional information is required, you will likely find it in PDFs or in the READMEs. In any case, feel free to **contact me**, also to give me a feedback about how to improve my works (I am always open to learning and establishing collaborations). You are free to use some pieces of code from this repo, as well as trying to reproduce results: I choose a CC0 licence for this. However, let me confess you that I could not learn so much about software without trying on my own or with colleagues to solve the thousands (not joking 😅) of bugs I encountered: I firmly suggest you to create your own **solutions**, also for personal satisfaction.

Below you find a summary of folders content. Have a nice stay and enjoy! 😄 

## Laboratory of Computational Phyiscs - mod A 💻
In this course I discovered all the major tricks of **Python**, learning how to use libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit learn and numba. You will find several **assignments and code exempla** that I tried to design in an elegant way. 

## Laboratory of Computational Physics - mod B 🧠
As a natural sequel of the mod A, this course aimed to teach **machine learning methods for physics analysis**, from gradient descent techniques to clustering and RBMs. You will find a set of commented exercises and a **final project on the simulation of a quantum many-body wavefunction via neural networks**, to investigate the ground state of the Trasverse Field Ising model.
